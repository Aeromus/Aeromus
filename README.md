## About Me

Howdy, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate of Utah State University with a BS in Computer Science. While at USU I worked extensivly for [AggieAir](https://uwrl.usu.edu/aggieair/) writting ground support software, working with linux machines, and participating in field ops. I am also a co-founder of USU's Free Software and Linux Club. I have a love of cybersecuirty and have attened both DEFCON and Blackhat with hopes to one day have a job in pentesting. When my head is not stuck in a terminal you can find me playing boardgames with friends or practicing Archery and Rifle.

## Projects
<details>
  <suummary> Some of my projects</summary>
  
### [GunBrokerBot](https://github.com/Aeromus/GunbrokerBot/tree/dev)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-b07219?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=ffffff)

The GunBrokerBot was a Java project born due to the 2020 ammo shortage. The bot will query any provided listings on Gunbroker.com and then use MailUtils to provide text and email alerts about changes to the listing (such as new bids or price). The project is a work in progress and will have new features added as I make time to work on it. 


### [MPI Password Cracker](https://github.com/Aeromus/MPIPasswordCracker)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=C%2B%2B&logoColor=ffffff)

As it says on a the tin, this was a password cracker using the MPI multiprocessing libary. The project was a collaberation between me and a classmate. The project is currently configured to crack passwords encoded in MD5 by attempting to hash every possible string until it comes across a match. Its not the most eligant method but the brute force approach shows off how multiprocessing can be used to decrease compute time.
